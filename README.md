## 📊 Sales Data Analysis – Power BI

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power BI Service

### 📝 Description
This project focused on analyzing sales data using Power BI. The dataset included three main tables:
- **Customers**
- **Products**
- **Sales**

A relational data model was built to connect these tables effectively. Using Power BI Desktop, I designed **interactive dashboards** with the following visuals:
- Bar charts to compare sales across cities
- Pie charts to show product category distribution
- Line graphs to analyze sales over time
- KPI cards summarizing total sales and quantities
