# 📊 Sales Data Analysis – Power BI

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power BI Service  

## 📝 Description
This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Power BI.  
The dataset includes **three main tables**:
- `Customers`
- `Products`
- `Sales`

A **relational data model** was built to connect these tables effectively.

Using **Power BI Desktop**, I designed interactive dashboards with the following visuals:
- 📊 **Bar charts** to compare sales across cities  
- 🥧 **Pie charts** showing product category distribution  
- 📈 **Line graphs** to analyze sales trends over time  
- 🔢 **KPI cards** summarizing total sales and quantities  

The final report was published to **Power BI Service** under *My Workspace* for online access and sharing.
